      I am a girl who codes from San Bruno, California. I will be in the 11th grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to focusing my every waking hour in constructing myself into a god-level academic student superstar, all to put my entire life story on a piece of paper to send to a bunch of old men at certain institutions. They have the power to lift my life, trash my life, and I am at their mercy as to whether I will have a good life. I live at a house with my family. When I’m not coding, you can find me leading a happy life.
